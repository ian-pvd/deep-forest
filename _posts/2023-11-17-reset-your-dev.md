You should probably reformat and factory reset your laptop either between major OS versions, projects, or yearly. The files on your work machine probably all exist somewhere in the cloud.

Setting your dev environment back up is a chore. These are copies of todo lists, config files, and guides I've written to speed up my next reinstall.

- Setting up iTerm and zsh
- vscode extensions & config
- node, homebrew, npm globals
